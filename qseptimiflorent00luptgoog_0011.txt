PREFACE.

ΙΤ is to be hoped that a scholar possessed os the

requisite ability and leisure may some day produce '
an edition of Tertullian's works worthy of the author.

The editor os the present Treatise can claim no such
qualifications, He only hopes that this little edition
may be os some use to studente until something better
is available.

lt would be ungrateful to let it go forth without
acknowledging the constant and ready help which has
been given in the preparation os it by two scholars,
to whom most grateful thanks are due-the General
Editor of the Series and the Rev. A. Wright, D.D.,

Viae-president os Queens' college, Cambridge.
