About half a century before Tel-tullian wrote the
de Bapttssfmss justin Martyr addressed tn the Emperor
Antoninus Pius his Fz'rst Apnsffgy, Justin dfficribes the
admissinn of nonvertss mentioning Baptista in the name
of the Trinitf with fasting and prayer, ancl prayers
before the brethren assembled with their head, which
may have been some form ns Confirmatiun. Tertullian
may have seen the Apes-223, but there ia nothing in this

knowledge of the earlier work. We cannot but be

century, ancl his work, is it had been preserved tn 115,
would have been very valuahle. But a 5tudy of the scanty
fragments that are preserved leads me tu the belief that
Tertullian did unt uffie it in writing the de Baptismffl.
