Note on the Apparatus Crz'ticus.

Except where otherwise noted, the text is that of
Reifferscheid and Wissowa‚ Vienna¹ 1890. Where their
text differs from that of Oehler, Leipzig, 1853, the
difference is indicated.

lt will be seen that l have returned to Oehler’s
notation os A sor Mesnart, B sor Gelenius &e The
Vienna editors, having used A to denote Codex Agabar-
dinus, in the Treatises where it is available‚ were not at
liberty to use it for Mesnart here. l hope that the
possibility os confusion will be outweighed by the con-
venience of using A sor the earliest edition and B, a, b,
sor those next in order. ln the textual notes

attributed to GangneiuS, Paris, 1545.

of confusion.
